#example of a tupple
rndm = ("M. Jackson", 1958, True)
print(rndm)

#tuple with a single item
# it needs a comma after it to distinguish as a tuple.

#if i try to edit the tupple we'll get a TypeError
# rndm[1] = 1968

# >>> rndm[1] = 1968
# >>> TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
